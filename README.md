# IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition
This project aims to analyze and predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset, which contains various attributes related to employee demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, performance ratings, etc., along with a target variable indicating whether an employee has left the company (Yes or No).

Instructions for running the code :
1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine.
2. Download the assignment files including the Jupyter notebook and the dataset files. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the Jupyter notebook file.
3. Once the notebook is open, you can run each cell by clicking on it and then pressing Shift + Enter. Make sure to run the cells in order as some cells may depend on the output of previous cells.
4. The notebook contains the entire code for the assignment, including data analysis, preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and optimization. The results of each step, including model accuracies and insights, are displayed in the notebook. The final part of the notebook contains visualizations and summaries of the analysis.
